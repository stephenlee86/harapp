# On-device Learning of Activity Recognition Networks
#### Personalized machine learning on the smartphone

The aim of the project is to provide an end-to-end solution for on-device training, inference and data collection for activity recongition based on <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/model_personalization">TFlite Transfer Learning Pipeline</a>. The corresponding blog post is available <a href="https://aqibsaeed.github.io/on-device-activity-recognition">here</a>. 

#### Tools Required
* Python 3.5+
* Tensorflow 2.0.0rc0
* Numpy
* Pillow 
* Scipy
* Android Studio

#### Contribute (Future Work)
* Add support for pairing the app with a smartwatch and fine-tuning the model for a wearable device.
* Port SoundNet, add functionality for audio recording and tflite model conversion for handling dynamic size input.
